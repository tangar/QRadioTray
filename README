Issues:

1. Ubuntu users:
Icons in menus are disabled by default. It's quite strange feature, but it exists, so:
* to enable icons in menu use this command:
gconftool-2 --type Boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons True
* to disable them (default state):
gconftool-2 --type Boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons False

2. Translation files must be placed in \translations directory
